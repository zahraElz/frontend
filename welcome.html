        <p>The goal of our project was to develop an application that would enable users to track their caffeine consumption and monitor how it impacts their sleep. To achieve this, we collected data on users' caffeine intake and sleep patterns, which we then used to generate graphs and visualizations. Through the app, users were able to see how their caffeine consumption affected their sleep quality and duration, as well as receive personalized recommendations on how to optimize their caffeine intake to improve their sleep. Overall, our project aimed to provide users with actionable insights into their caffeine consumption habits and promote healthier sleep practices.</p>
